# ML-Scout-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Recommending-Football-Players
Using the Wyscout datasets for season 2017/18 in the top five European competitions( English first-division, French first-division, German first-division, 
Spanish first-division and Italian first-division ) and the unsupervised learning techniques, an algorithm that detects the weaknesses in the team and recommends a player to
overcome this weakness is built.

I used the webscrapping techniques to fetch data from transfermarkt website and there is a csv file that has thi data.
